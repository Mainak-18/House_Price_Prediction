# House Price Prediction

A machine learning project to predict house prices based on features like location, square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), bathrooms, and more. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and evaluation to provide accurate predictions and insights into property values.

## Overview
The goal is to create a predictive model that estimates house prices and identifies key factors influencing property values. This helps buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed decisions.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, duplicates, and outliers.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes relationships between features and target variable.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Creates meaningful features like price per square foot and encoded location data.  
- **Model Building:** Implements regression and tree-based models.  
- **Prediction:** Provides house price predictions for new properties.  

## Technologies
- Python 3.12
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, GridSearchCV, SplitShuffle, CrossVal
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mainak-18/House_Price_Prediction.git
